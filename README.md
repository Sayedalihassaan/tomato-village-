Tomato Village - Tomato Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Welcome to Tomato Village! This project aims to classify different varieties of tomatoes using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented with Keras and TensorFlow. With the help of deep learning techniques, we can accurately identify various types of tomatoes, aiding in agricultural processes, food industry sorting, and more.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation contains images of different types of tomatoes. The dataset is sourced from [insert source here], and it consists of labeled images of various tomato varieties, each belonging to one of several classes (e.g., cherry tomatoes, beefsteak tomatoes, Roma tomatoes, etc.).

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

data/: Directory containing the dataset images.
models/: Directory containing saved model checkpoints and trained models.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
src/: Source code for the CNN model, data preprocessing, and utility functions.
requirements.txt: File listing the required Python packages for running the project.
